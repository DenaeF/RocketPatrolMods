# Mods Added to Rocket Patrol

- Implement the 'FIRE UI' text from the original game (5)
- Add your own (copyright free) background music to the Play scene(5)   
                 (This I feel is different than change the sound because to me sound means sound effects and this specifically is different because it says background music rather than sound)

- Create 4 new explosion SFX and randomize which one plays on impact(10)
- Display the time remaning (in seconds) on the screen (10)
- Create a new title screen (new artwork, typography, layout)(10)   
                 (I don't know if this is counted for the game or this is seperate from gameplay because it's the title screen)
                 
- Create a new animated sprite for the Spaceship enemies(10)           
                 (It does say new artwork on the 60 pt one for the game but I made mine animated, hopefully this is different than the 60pt one)
                 
- Redesign the game's artwork, UI, and sound to change its theme/aesthetic (to something other than sci-fi)(60)
